# Content Scheduler for Instagram & Threads üöÄ

This project automates publishing content to **Instagram** and **Threads** directly from a Google Sheet. It handles scheduling, media uploads from local files or URLs, and API token management, allowing you to build a complete, hands-off content pipeline.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Multi-Platform:** Publish to Instagram (single images/videos, carousels) and Threads (single images/videos, text).
  * **Google Sheets Backend:** Manage your entire content schedule from a single, simple spreadsheet.
  * **Flexible Media Sourcing:** Use media from public web URLs or upload directly from your local computer.
  * **Automated Token Management:** A daily script automatically refreshes API access tokens to ensure uninterrupted operation.
  * **Status Tracking:** Automatically updates your Google Sheet with a `Published` or `Failed` status for each post.
  * **Cross-Platform Scheduler:** A helper script automatically sets up the required scheduled tasks on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  * **Local File Hosting:** Automatically uploads local media to a designated GitHub repository to generate the public URLs required by the Meta APIs.
  * **Repo Maintenance:** Includes a utility script to periodically clean up the temporary media files hosted on GitHub.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide

Follow these steps carefully to configure and launch the scheduler.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * Git
  * A Google Account
  * A Meta Developer Account
  * An Instagram Professional Account linked to a Facebook Page
  * A GitHub Account

### 2\. Project Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    # Create the venv
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3\. Google Sheets API

1.  **Create a Google Sheet** with the columns you need (see the Usage section for details).
2.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
3.  In your project, enable the **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheets API**.
4.  Go to **Credentials**, click **Create Credentials**, and choose **Service Account**.
5.  On the Keys tab for your new service account, create a **JSON** key. A `credentials.json` file will be downloaded. Move this file to the root of your project folder.
6.  Open `credentials.json`, copy the `client_email` address, and **Share** your Google Sheet with that email, granting it **Editor** permissions.

### 4\. Meta APIs (Instagram & Threads)

1.  Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new App of type "Business".
2.  From your App Dashboard, add the **Instagram Graph API** and **Threads API** products.
3.  For the **Instagram API**, grant the following permissions in the App's settings:
      * `instagram_basic`
      * `instagram_content_publish`
      * `pages_read_engagement`
      * `business_management`
      * `pages_show_list`
4.  For the **Threads API**, grant `threads_basic` and `threads_content_publish` permissions.

### 5\. GitHub API for Media Hosting

1.  Create a new **Public** GitHub repository. This will be used to store your media files.
2.  Go to your GitHub **Settings \> Developer settings \> Personal access tokens \> Tokens (classic)**.
3.  Generate a new token with the full **`repo`** scope. Copy the token immediately.

### 6\. Application Configuration (.env)

1.  Create your `.env` file from the example template:

    ```bash
    # On Windows
    copy .env.example .env

    # On macOS/Linux
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  Open the new `.env` file and fill in all the values. The script uses the `*_COLUMN_NAME` variables to find the correct columns in your sheet, regardless of their order.

    ```dotenv
    # --- Meta App Credentials ---
    APP_ID="YOUR_META_APP_ID"
    APP_SECRET="YOUR_META_APP_SECRET"

    # --- Google Sheets Settings ---
    GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME="Your Content Schedule Sheet Name"

    # --- GitHub Media Repo Settings ---
    GITHUB_USERNAME="your-github-username"
    GITHUB_REPO_NAME="your-media-repo-name"
    GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"

    # --- Column Names in Your Google Sheet ---
    DATE_COLUMN_NAME="Date"
    TIME_COLUMN_NAME="Time"
    STATUS_COLUMN_NAME="Status"
    TEXT_COLUMN_NAME="Text"
    IMAGE_URLS_COLUMN_NAME="Image URLs"
    VIDEO_URLS_COLUMN_NAME="Video URLs"
    LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH_COLUMN_NAME="Local Image Path"
    LOCAL_VIDEO_PATH_COLUMN_NAME="Local Video Path"
    HASHTAGS_COLUMN_NAME="Hashtags"
    HASHTAGS_IN_CAPTION_COLUMN_NAME="Hashtags with TEXT"
    POST_ON_INSTAGRAM_COLUMN_NAME="Post on Instagram"
    POST_ON_THREADS_COLUMN_NAME="Post on Threads"
    THREADS_TEXT_ONLY_COLUMN_NAME="Do Not Post Media on Threads"
    ```

### 7\. Generate API Tokens

1.  Use the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) to get a short-lived User Access Token for your app. Make sure to grant all the permissions you configured in Step 4.

2.  Use the [Access Token Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/) to find the **User ID** associated with that token.

3.  Run the token generation script. It will prompt you for the short-lived token and User ID for both Instagram and Threads.

    ```bash
    python generate_initial_token.py
    ```

    This will create a `token_storage.json` file with permanent, auto-refreshing tokens.

## üìù Usage

### The Google Sheet

To schedule a post, add a new row and fill in the columns.

| Column Name                  | Required? | Description                                                                                      | Example                                                  |

### Running the Script

  * **Manual Run (for testing):**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

  * **Automated Scheduling:** Use the helper script to manage scheduled tasks. **Note:** On Windows, you must run this from an **Administrator** terminal.

    ```bash
    # Add all jobs (poster, token refresh, repo cleanup)
    python setup_scheduler.py add

    # Remove all jobs
    python setup_scheduler.py remove
    ```

-----

## üßπ Maintenance

The `uploads` folder in your GitHub repository will fill up with media over time. A script is included to clean this folder.

```bash
python clean_github_uploads.py
```

This script is also scheduled to run weekly when you use `setup_scheduler.py add`.

-----

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

  * **`404 Not Found` from GitHub:** Your repository is private, or your Personal Access Token is missing the full `repo` scope.
  * **Video Posts Fail on Instagram/Threads:** Your video file is likely not formatted correctly. Re-encode it using a tool like [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) with the **"Web Optimized"** setting checked.
  * **"Ghost Posts" (Success in logs but not visible):** This is often caused by Meta's automated content review. Test with a different, simpler image and caption to see if your original content was flagged.
  * **`400 Bad Request`:** Check that all your media URLs are public and provide a direct link to the file, not a webpage.
